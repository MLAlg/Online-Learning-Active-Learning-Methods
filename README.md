# Online-Learning- Active-Learning Methods
Advanced Machine Learning Project

Online learning is a binary classification algorithm which is an extension of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Unlike SVM where So that we update the weights using batches of data samples or all datasamples; here we only update the weights using one example at a time. At every iteration, we only update the weight associated with the datasample until we reach the last index.

In active learning, the objective is to minimize the number of labels to query using a probabilistic criterion Bernoulli random distribution. In this way, the active learner aims to achieve high accuracy using as few labeled instances as possible, thereby minimizing the cost of obtaining labeled data.
